# Haskell-Travelling-Salesman
===
Travelling Salesman Problem Solver written in Haskell for the 2015 Glasgow University Tech Society Hackathon.

Haskell was used to code up 4 different algorithms:
one of my own devising (going through edges by increasing length trying to build up bigger and bigger fragments and loops to be joined up),
a Random Path Generator,
the Pairwise Exchange Algorithm (2-opt) and
the Furthest Insertion Algorithm.
I could not finish my own algorithm, but each of the other ones yielded paths of satisfyingly short lengths;
from best to worst: 2-opt, Furthest Insertion and Random Generator.
